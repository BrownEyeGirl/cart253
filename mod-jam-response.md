The aesthetics of this game are light, fun, joyful, and nostalgic: a reminder of simpler times when CoolMathGames was the student’s escape of choice. I love how the frog is clearly hand-drawn and seamlessly blends with the rest of the project. The sounds are also a brilliant addition, with light jazz serenating the user during gameplay. 

Its difficult to suggest any improvements as the bases are well covered: Game is interactive, visuals are impressive, the sound is well done, and actual design of the game is cohesive and interesting. If i could suggest one thing it would be to play around with the dynamics of the game. While the flies moving differently is clever, it would be interesting to see wings flapping, or a fly looking like a bug instead of a dot. Further, the sky and grass could be dynamic: what if the clouds are moving? What if the grass is blowing in some non-existant digital wind? 

Overall this game is fabulous and I would not change anything, only improvements are additions to make the game more complex.

Another fun twist on the FrogFrogFrog game \- a dynamic frog\! I love the rich green tones and the pastel pinks contrasting eachother, the game is very visually appealing and easy to use; however, I would make the game slightly easier and more geered to the user. To do this, the tongue could be bigger and the flies could be more concentrated to the upper quadrant of the screen. Though they were beautiful, I did not understand the purpose of the flowers at the end of the screen. They bobbed up and down in the same manner as interactive lilypads, but I could not interact with them. To fix this, I would simply change the colours, disperse them more, or change their behaviours to bare less of a resemblance to the interactive lilypads. The music is a nice touch tough, and the dynamic flies and lilypads add a strong audio/visual experience for the user. Further, the instructions on the corner of the screen were a nice touch and make the whole experience more user friendly. Overall my favourite part is the colour choices and the bobbing lilypads.

Fight Fight Fight is so fun to play\! Visually, the components are engaging and the fast-paced graphics and tunnel vision focus are really addictive. I found this to be the most addictive of the three games because of these features. I love the viewfinder pov of the gun and the hypnotizing visuals in the background. The noise visualized as the word “Boom\!” is a nice touch, it gives the game a comic-book feel that matches with the drawn features. I love the different screens as well, the dynamic enemy makes the game feel complex and storylike. 

For improvements, I would not change anything but I would add a clear instruction screen and more features. I think theres a really good opportunity here to add in an audio feature for shooting or just generally as background noise to match with (or juxtapose) the visually loud aesthetic of the game. I also did not understand the purpose of the green/red bars that appear over the screen after a few seconds. This could easily be cleared up in an instructions page. 

I love this game though, especially how it felt like playing an action comic book.
