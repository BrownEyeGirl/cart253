## Description

> *DEBUGGING* - Play as a flytrap to debug the game! Whenever you catch a bug, the game debugs itself.

> The experience is contrilled via the arrow keys and mouse clicks, as the user maneuvers the flytrap and tongue to catch all the bugs.  

> The project is meant to transcend the conversational boundary between user and programmer, with the user directly affecting the bugs in the code without interacting with the code itself.
