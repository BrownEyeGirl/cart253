## Description

Volume on! Music! Visuals! CLICK ON THE IMAGE TO BEGIN the randomly generated beat, then toggle with the slide to change what tones you hear. The buttons control the visuals. 

This project was my personal exploration of the sound and image library. Some code is commented out from earlier versions and experiments.
