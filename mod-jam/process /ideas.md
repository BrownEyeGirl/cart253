# Starting points


Finding metro tickets on the ground and trying to sell them

**Frog eating flies but it gets harder and harder to catch them**

Swimming lessons but controlling your body is really hard

Crossing the street and it’s busy

Riding a tricycle but the wheel keeps falling off

Shaving people’s heads in beautiful patterns and showing them at an art gallery

Making cups out of clay and seeing what cafe customers say about them

Growing plants that eat you

Keeping a computer mouse as a pet and looking after it

Rewiring a light

Cooking spaghetti with a dog



IDEAS: 
Gamify! 
Screens/states
1. The frog can collect hats with his tongue as well as the flies (easy, hats floating as well as flies, when he gets a hat its added to his head)
2. The flies are actually fairies and the frog is evil (evil laugh and eyes to show this)
3. The frog slowly turns into a witch for every fly he catches (his skin slowly gets pinker and his nose gets bigger)
4. The frog slowly turns into a prince for every fly he catches (same concept as 3)
5. The frog slowly turns into a prince for every KISS he catches (Kisses flying through the sky!)
6. The flies dont move linearly (buzzing in circles around a linear path)
7. The frog makes chewing sounds when he gets a fly and the fly buzzes (easy addition to the catch the fly function)
8. The sky has clouds that the frog can also eat (by accident) (easy, program the clouds like the fly)
9. There are powerups that give you more time in the game (have special fly functions that can change the time variables)
10. The frog can move all around the perimeter of the screen (Same concept just x3 for the other borders)
11. The flies avoid the frog (no winners) (make it impossible to win )
12. There is a button to make the frog ribbit (space bar duh)
13. The water makes ripples every time the frog sticks out its tongue (activate a background animation whenever mouse is clicked)
14. The frog gets bigger every time it eats a fly (have variables to scale the frog)
15. Every time the frog gets a fly the colours all change up  (frog, fly, and sky)
16. There is another frog that tries to eat the flies before you (like a lil robot, it can be coordinated with the flies location or it can be random)
17. Every time you catch a fly a frog fact appears above your screen (easy, add text feature to catch fly function)
18. The frog gets a crown when it wins and when you play again you keep the crown (have a true/false crown variable that controls the crown graphics function)
19. Evil mode like in pacman where the flies try to eat the frog sometimes (sky can turn red and flies eyes can go red too)
20. Frogs eyes blink (simple animation for the frog)






start (situation)

    - 
    - 

end state (conclusion)
