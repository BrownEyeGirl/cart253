	Leah’s project depicts glowing stars of assorted colours ‘falling’ from the top of the screen. I’m fascinated by how she played with depth and perspective to achieve the nostalgic feeling of watching falling snow. I was inspired by how clever and simple the techniques were for depicting movement.

Leah describes it as a representation of herself: random, sparkly, colourful, and full of depth. The project uses randomness as a foundation, which could easily be manipulated or constrained through interactive inputs. To add an interactive element, it would be interesting to allow users to control aspects such as the types of shapes falling (e.g., snowflakes, raindrops), the glow intensity of the stars, the density of their dispersion, or even their direction of movement.

In a broader artistic context, this piece is original in the way it combines a starry night sky with the motion of falling snow or rain. This ethereal vignette could serve as a strong foundation for video game backgrounds, pattern generation, or projection-mapped art.

	The creative and calculated use of shapes in this project is mind-blowing. When I focus closely, I can see how each feature was constructed using circles, triangles, and rectangles \- but at first glance, all the shapes blend seamlessly to create a unified character.

While this cartoon-esque figure does not physically resemble Norah, their playful and curious attitude is clearly captured through the bright colours and inquisitive pose. The program uses fixed variables, with the only changing elements being the eyes and the fly. It would be interesting to explore how to code character movement without disrupting the seamless blending of the character’s components.

The interactive aspect is delightful — the user gets to play as a harmless fly interacting with this character. This sets the groundwork for a larger world, with the potential for a storyline, additional characters, and more complex environments. I would love to play a video game or watch a TV series featuring this adorable creature as the protagonist.

In this project, the user sees five circles rotating at different speeds around the origin. Each circle includes an interactive component, adding to the dynamic quality of the piece.

I’m fascinated by this work because I can’t quite understand how Edmond made it \- specifically, how he achieved the overlapping translucent images. From the refined design to the deconstructed images of body parts, this feels like a piece of contemporary art.

My favourite part is when all the circles overlap, forming one unified grey circle. The work is hypnotic \- watching it feels like a contemporary version of the ‘NO SIGNAL’ box floating around an old TV screen as the viewer waits for it to hit the corner. It could be interesting to experiment with different types of images within the circles, such as close-up portraits, distinct patterns, or variations in colour and tone.
